For this reason, we need to analyze different scenarios in the area to make sure that the restaurant will be successful in the area. We are going to try to avoid others Burger Joint in the area and we are looking for a area where there are:\n - Schools\n - Universities\n - Offices\n\nFor this project we are mainly concerned with the area around Bogota to setup a Burger Joint to ensure maximum profitability for Carol's new business.\n",
